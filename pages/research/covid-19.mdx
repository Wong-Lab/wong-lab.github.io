# Physical Immunology of COVID-19

Our team is working to uncover the physical factors that cause the coronavirus
responsible for COVID-19 to be so hyperinfectious and hyperinflammatory. We seek
to understand the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms,
catastrophic coagulation, skin rashes, and lesions known as MIS-C, 'covid
fingers and toes'. Moreover, we seek to investigate the possible connection
between COVID and autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and
atherosclerosis.

We are utilizing our machine learning added analyses to explore why some
coronaviruses can cause these severe symptoms while others do not and the
phenomenon of 'long COVID'. Studying these factors is critical to developing
effective treatments and therapies for COVID-19 patients and preventing future
pandemics.

Through our research, we hope to uncover new insights into the complex
interactions between the virus and the human body and provide a better
understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive the development of severe
COVID-19 symptoms, while simultaneously setting it apart from other viruses.
